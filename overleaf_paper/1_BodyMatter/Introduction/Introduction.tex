Background\\
Why we are interested in fusion of UAV and aerial imagery\\
Formulating the problem/challenge\\
\section{Objectives}
This thesis aims to utilize aerial and UAV imagey to enrich the representation of the scene. More concretely, the goal is achieved by solving three specific problems.\\

\textbf{Objective 1:}\\
Co-registration of aerial and UAV imagery\\
Application: improve geo-referencing accuracy of UAV imagery\\

\textbf{Objective 2:}\\
Semantic scene parsing on UAV image\\
Application: optimize OSM footprints\\

\textbf{Objective 3:}\\
Weakly-and semi-supervised learning of UAV images based on label propagation\\
Application: automatically generate ground-truth data for UAV/Aerial images
